This plugin changes multiple select boxes into a facebook inspired select system.

Features:
* loading select options via ajax call
* modular design
* live bindings
* 100% css styled (not tested under IE)
* select all / unselect all links above or under the collection
* customisable item rendering

Inspired from emposha <admin@emposha.com> original work on fcbkListSelection. Still using the same look'n feel from that project.
